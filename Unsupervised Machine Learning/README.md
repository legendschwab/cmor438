Unsupervised Machine Learning is a class of machine learning where we work with data that is unlabelled. These algorithms attempt to detect relationships based on the features of the data without it already being pre-labelled. 

Examples Include:
1. K-Means Clustering
2. DBSCAN
3. Principal Component Analysis
4. Image Compression with SVD Decomposition
